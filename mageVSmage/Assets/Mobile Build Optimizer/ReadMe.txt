// FAQ /////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1. Will this tool always optimize my Android build in the best way?
   Mobile Build Optimizer will optimize assets and project settings in the optimal way, but sometimes manual correction may be a little bit better. This tool is created to save developer's time and help beginners to optimize their Android/iOS build in very short amount of time.
But in any way, this auto optimization will be surely better than non-optimized build.
